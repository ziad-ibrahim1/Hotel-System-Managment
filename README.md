## Technologies Used

- **C++**  
- **MySQL**  
- **MySQL Connector/C++**
- **Console-based UI**

## Prerequisites

- MySQL server installed and running
- MySQL Connector/C++ installed
- A MySQL database named `Hotel` with appropriate tables created
- Compiler that supports C++11 or later (e.g., g++, MSVC)

## Database Schema

You should have a MySQL database named `Hotel` with the following tables:

### `Customer`
```sql
CREATE TABLE Customer (
    ID VARCHAR(14) PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Age INT,
    Phone VARCHAR(20),
    Email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

### `Employee`
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    ID VARCHAR(14) PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Position VARCHAR(100),
    Salary DOUBLE
);
```

### `Room`
```sql
CREATE TABLE Room (
    Number INT PRIMARY KEY,
    NumberOfbeds INT,
    NumberOfPeople INT,
    Price DOUBLE,
    Bathroom VARCHAR(50)
);
```

### `Options`
```sql
CREATE TABLE Options (
    OptionID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    OptionName VARCHAR(100),
    Price DOUBLE
);
```

### `Hall`
```sql
CREATE TABLE Hall (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    NumberOfPeople INT,
    Occasion VARCHAR(100)
);
```

### `Reservation`
```sql
CREATE TABLE Reservation (
    ReservationID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID VARCHAR(14),
    RoomNumber INT,
    NumberOfDays INT,
    TotalPrice DOUBLE,
    Status VARCHAR(20),
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customer(ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (RoomNumber) REFERENCES Room(Number)
);
```

### `ReservationOptions`
```sql
CREATE TABLE ReservationOptions (
    ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    ReservationID INT,
    OptionID INT,
    Quantity INT,
    OptionPrice DOUBLE,
    FOREIGN KEY (ReservationID) REFERENCES Reservation(ReservationID),
    FOREIGN KEY (OptionID) REFERENCES Options(OptionID)
);
```

### `ReservationHalls`
```sql
CREATE TABLE ReservationHalls (
    ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    ReservationID INT,
    HallID INT,
    Quantity INT,
    Price DOUBLE,
    FOREIGN KEY (ReservationID) REFERENCES Reservation(ReservationID),
    FOREIGN KEY (HallID) REFERENCES Hall(ID)
);
```

## Admin Login

- **Username**: `admin`  
- **Password**: `1234`

You have 3 attempts before the program exits.

## How to Compile

Make sure you link against the MySQL Connector library. Example using `g++`:

```sh
g++ main.cpp -o hotel -lmysqlcppconn
```

Or using Visual Studio, make sure to include the MySQL Connector/C++ headers and link the appropriate `.lib` files.

## How to Run

```sh
